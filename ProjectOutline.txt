Objective:
    Solve a WordBrain puzzle by returning all possible correct words

User Input:
    size of maze and the letters
    size of word

Data Structures:
    2d Array of nodes that hold a char and boolean
    Hash Map Database (possible)

Algorithms
    Pathing algorithm
    Check with database (probably binary search)

Order of Code:
    User Input
    Create Graph
    Establish Database
    Search through Graph
    Check words to Database
    Print list of words
    Repeat

Future Goals:
    Make it learn as words are used, put more emphasis on the words that have
    been used before

    Fully solve the puzzle instead of just finding one word

Unsolved Methods:
    goBackOne()	//Doesn't unmark anything but changes position and tempWord.
		//
    next()
    testWords()
    findParents()
